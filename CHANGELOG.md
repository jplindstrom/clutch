# Personal Changelog

### 2026-07-06

- Added `clutch-connect-using-file`, which enables `clutch-mode` and connects using the `clutch-connection-alist` profile named after the visited file's base name. Invoking it again while the buffer already has a live connection disconnects instead of reconnecting.

# Changelog

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-28

### Breaking Changes

- Removed the `:ssh-tunnel` saved-connection parameter, its `direct-first` route probing and fallback, and `clutch-ssh-direct-first-probe-timeout-seconds`. The old key now fails fast. Define separate direct and `:ssh-host` saved connections, optionally sharing one `:profile-entry`; `:ssh-host` now unconditionally requests an SSH tunnel.
- **Result-cell preview overhaul:** Removed the `V` live-view commands, their bottom-window viewer, and freeze/refresh/quit controls.  `v` remains the explicit full value viewer; optional automatic child-frame previews are now controlled by `clutch-cell-preview-style`, appear only for visibly truncated cells, fit tightly to their formatted content, follow window resizing, use a theme-relative contrasting surface, and silently stay disabled on unsupported displays.
- Removed the public `clutch-execute-query-at-point` and `clutch-execute-statement-at-point` commands.  Use `clutch-execute-dwim`, `clutch-execute-region`, or `clutch-execute-buffer`; select a region first when exact execution boundaries matter.
- Removed the undocumented `clutch-execute` command and its direct arbitrary-buffer execution behavior.  Execute through the connection-local DWIM, region, or buffer commands; the explicit indirect-edit workflow remains available for SQL embedded in other source buffers.
- Removed the ClickHouse-only `clutch-switch-database` command.  Use `clutch-switch-schema` for every backend; ClickHouse still selects a database by reconnecting internally.
- Removed `clutch-switch-console`.  `clutch-query-console` now lists both open consoles and saved connections, including open temporary and SQLite consoles.
- Removed the table-specific `clutch-describe-table`, `clutch-describe-table-at-point`, and `clutch-browse-table` commands.  Use `clutch-describe-dwim` or `clutch-act-dwim`.
- Removed the standalone `clutch-result-insert-mode` entry point and its public map/hook.  Open insert forms with `clutch-result-insert-row` from a result.
- Removed the `:tramp` saved-connection parameter spelling.  Use `:tramp-default-directory` for explicit TRAMP connection origins.
- Native MongoDB now requires mongodb.el's public connection host, port, and username accessors. Update mongodb.el when Clutch reports a missing public API instead of relying on configured parameters that may not describe the effective endpoint.
- Reduced the native MongoDB console to common reads, generated single-document mutations, `runCommand`, and `ObjectId` / `ISODate`.  Database switching now uses `clutch-switch-schema`; dedicated admin/index helpers, database aggregation, multi-document mutations, cursor `batchSize` / `comment`, and numeric/timestamp constructor aliases were removed.
- Generated Redis hash Browse now requires Redis 6.2 or newer because bounded sampling uses `HRANDFIELD`.  On older servers, issue `HSCAN` or `HGETALL` manually instead.
- Native PostgreSQL now requires current pg-el with `pgcon-transaction-status`; update pg-el if Clutch reports that the accessor is unavailable.

### Added

- **Explicit DEFAULT cell editing:** Single-cell edit buffers now show `Set NULL` only for nullable columns and `Set DEFAULT` only for columns and backends that support it.  DEFAULT remains staged SQL syntax rather than a bound string, and displays as `<default>` with the NULL placeholder face.
- Added backend-owned namespace switching through the shared `clutch-switch-schema` entrypoint: file-backed DuckDB can switch schemas within its current catalog, MongoDB enumerates visible databases through `mongodb.el`, and ClickHouse keeps reconnect-based database switching without leaking its mechanics into the command layer.

### Documentation

- Replaced the root `README.org` with GitHub-flavored `README.md`, moved the built-in SQLite Quick Start to the top, rewrote capability and installation sections around user outcomes, added README authoring guardrails, and updated active repository references to the new path.

### Fixed

- Stopped treating every known tabular SQL command as SELECT-pageable. `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, and `EXPLAIN` now execute unchanged as non-pageable result grids; only `SELECT` and SELECT-producing CTEs receive automatic pagination and row-identity preparation. This fixes MySQL `SHOW INDEX` syntax errors, PostgreSQL `SHOW` failures, changed `EXPLAIN` semantics, and equivalent JDBC-dialect breakage. Regression coverage also pins the existing non-pageable handling of SQLite `PRAGMA` / `VALUES` / `RETURNING` and stored-procedure calls.
- Converged the three end-of-session paths on one teardown transition, so closing a live connection, releasing an already dead one, and preserving one for reconnect no longer each spell out their own step sequence. The differences between them are now guarded lines in a single function with a test asserting each kind's steps, which is how a step added to one path but forgotten in another gets caught.
- Bounded object-completion metadata enrichment by time as well as candidate count. Redis answers each candidate's value type with its own round trip, so the previous 64-candidate cap still let one completion display block for the round-trip time of 64 keys — noticeable on a remote server and no longer interruptible by typing. Enrichment now stops at a 0.05s budget per affixation call; unenriched candidates keep their discovered type and are filled in by later calls as earlier results cache.
- Taught the SQL scanner which dialect it is reading. Statement splitting, masking, and context bounds now take a dialect plist derived from the connection's `sql-product`, so a MySQL escaped quote no longer ends a literal early -- previously `UPDATE t SET note = 'it\\'s here; keep' WHERE ...` split at the semicolon inside the value and sent the fragment as a statement. PostgreSQL dollar-quoting reaches context bounds through the same parameter, so completion and Eldoc split statements the way execution does.
- Extended dialect coverage to engines the `sql-product` mapping missed: Snowflake and ClickHouse have no `sql-mode` product, and Redshift's PostgreSQL 8.0 lineage always processes backslash escapes, so all three now register explicit lexical rules (backslash escapes and dollar-quoted bodies) that statement splitting, JDBC literal escaping, and buffer-side statement selection consult through the connection.
- Stopped rewriting jsonb's question-mark operators as PostgreSQL placeholders. Parameter substitution and the PostgreSQL `$N` rewrite now share one placeholder scanner that passes `?|` / `?&` through, accepts `??` as the spelling for a bare `?` operator, skips dollar-quoted bodies, and reads literals with the connection's dialect; the PostgreSQL rewrite also verifies the placeholder count against the supplied parameters so an operator taken for a placeholder fails loudly instead of binding parameters to the wrong positions.
- Made the REPL execute only when the trailing semicolon really ends a statement. A semicolon at end of line inside an open string literal used to execute the fragment before it, sending half a statement with an unterminated literal; input now keeps accumulating until a top-level terminator, judged with the connection's dialect.
- Kept lost-transaction evidence across connection retirement. The preserve teardown cleared the transaction-dirty flag along with everything else, but for a session that died holding uncommitted DML that flag is the only record the server rolled the transaction back — with it gone, `clutch-commit` on the replacement session reconnected and committed an empty transaction instead of refusing, and reconnect stopped reporting the loss. Preserve now keeps the flag for `clutch--lost-transaction-p` to consume; the two tests that had pinned the clearing as expected now pin the survival.
- Made MongoDB generated mutations target the documents they came from. mongodb.el's decoder used to produce values its encoder could not read back — a decoded ObjectId re-encoded as an embedded document, so an update or delete keyed on a decoded `_id` silently matched nothing, and decoded arrays could not re-encode at all. mongodb.el's codec is now bijective (arrays decode to vectors, empty documents and empty arrays stay distinct from null, non-finite doubles and every non-scalar type round-trip through their Extended JSON tags), and a regression test pins that an `_id` filter built from a decoded document encodes as a real ObjectId.
- Scoped the JDBC RPC-timeout fallback to the connection that timed out, and gave the release a path that actually lands. The shared agent serves requests on a thread pool, so one stuck JDBC call — easiest to trigger through metadata introspection, which has no server-side statement timeout — says nothing about other connections' sessions; the previous fallback killed the whole JVM, destroying every other JDBC connection and their open transactions (Oracle sessions default to manual commit). A silent request now retires only its own connection and asks the agent to drop it through the new lock-bypassing `force-disconnect` op (agent 0.2.17): the ordinary disconnect queues behind the very locks the stuck call is holding, so it could never land, while the forced release removes the session immediately and closes its resources off-thread. The process-wide reset remains for a dead agent process and for requests no connection owns, such as the startup handshake and connect; older agents answer `force-disconnect` with an unknown-op error that is ignored, leaving behaviour no worse than before.
- Stopped re-hashing the JDBC agent jar on every logical connect. The 2.4MB checksum cost 10-20ms per connection while verifying nothing the already-running JVM cared about; verification now happens where integrity matters — shared-JVM startup and right after download. Agent 0.2.17 also cheapens every response line: values serialize straight to UTF-8 bytes over the raw file descriptor with exactly one flush per protocol line instead of materializing an intermediate UTF-16 string and double-flushing through `System.out`, and fractional-second formatting drops its per-value format-spec parse and regex compile.
- Made MySQL values arrive as the server sent them. mysql.el decodes BLOB and binary-charset columns to raw bytes instead of corrupting them through UTF-8 decoding, and DECIMAL values keep their exact digit string in both protocols instead of rounding through a float, so a DECIMAL cell now displays the stored digits exactly. Interrupted MySQL sessions also fail closed once any part of a response has been consumed — a cancelled or abandoned query can no longer leave a connection that silently feeds the previous response to the next command, while a query interrupted before its response started still recovers in place through the out-of-band cancel-and-drain path.
- Stopped connection transports from surviving an interrupted connect. Connection building only translated `clutch-db-error`, so a `C-g` while the database connect waited — or any other error class — crossed the function without stopping the SSH tunnel or TRAMP forward it had just started, leaving an `ssh -N` process running with nothing tracking it. The same window existed inside tunnel startup itself, whose readiness wait is quittable before any owner knows the process. Both now clean up on every non-success exit.
- Escaped backslashes in JDBC string literals for ClickHouse and Snowflake, whose literals read one as an escape. The escaped literal is concatenated into executed SQL by foreign-key navigation and ClickHouse table discovery, so a value ending in a backslash closed the literal early. Engines that keep backslash literal are unchanged, because doubling it there would store a character the user never typed.
- Stopped routing a commented or newline-led SQLite `SELECT` to the DML path, which ran the statement and discarded its rows. Leading comments are stripped before the keyword test, and whitespace is matched explicitly rather than through `\\s-`, which resolved against `sql-mode' syntax where newline ends a comment instead of being whitespace.
- Closed the backend connection when initialization fails or is quit. Initialization runs statements, so the backend already held a socket that no caller had a reference to.
- Gave the JDBC agent process an explicit UTF-8 coding system rather than inheriting the locale's, and cleared the reused stderr buffer at startup so a previous agent's output cannot be reported as the current one's startup failure.
- Made top-level SQL clause detection linear instead of quadratic in statement length. Clause, paging, row-identity, transaction-dirty, and completion scans collected their candidate positions by re-searching the rest of the statement at every scanned character. Long generated statements paid for that on every execution and every completion keystroke: a 15 KB statement spent 489 ms in three representative clause checks and now spends 0.32 ms, and per-keystroke completion token lookup on a 5.5 KB statement dropped from 11.4 ms to 0.6 ms.
- Stopped `clutch-commit` from reporting success for a transaction the server had already discarded. A manual-commit session that dies is no longer silently replaced by a reconnect whose empty transaction commits cleanly; `clutch-commit`, `clutch-rollback`, and `clutch-toggle-auto-commit` now report the loss and stop. Automatic reconnect still recovers query workflows, but says that uncommitted changes were lost and marks open DML result buffers as rolled back.
- Recovered the MySQL wire session after a parameterized statement times out. `clutch-db-execute-params` now runs the same cancel-and-drain recovery as plain queries instead of treating the timeout as an ordinary error, which left the connection desynchronized and corrupted every later query on it. The prepared statement is released only after recovery has resynchronized the wire.
- Escaped the symbol in MySQL `HELP` lookups instead of interpolating it into the statement.
- Made `C-c C-m`, `C-c C-u`, and `C-c C-a` available directly in attached SQL Result Browser and Record views when the connection supports manual transactions. Result `C-c C-c` still executes locally staged row mutations; transaction commit remains the separate `C-c C-m` step.
- Fixed Oracle/JDBC staged edits of BLOB and RAW/BINARY columns that could fail with `ORA-01465: invalid hex number`, and updated the agent pin to 0.2.16. Clutch now retains exact JDBC column types and text-BLOB source encodings, transports binary values through a reserved base64 parameter envelope, and preserves the distinction between typed SQL NULL and a non-null zero-byte value. The agent binds non-empty BLOB values through the JDBC binary data interface to avoid Oracle's temporary-LOB round trips, uses an explicitly managed empty BLOB for a non-null zero-byte value, and binds RAW/BINARY-family values with `setBytes`; ordinary prepared parameters keep their existing behavior.
- Kept SQL identifier and keyword completion ahead of global fallback CAPFs regardless of package load order, without depending on Corfu-specific hook reordering.
- Returned point-local Embark object targets with scalar bounds, so `embark-act` on a Query Console table name no longer passes a one-element list as the target end position. Non-default object action labels now use standard keymap menu items instead of advising an Embark private function.
- Reorganized the result dispatch into two balanced workflow rows, kept staged mutation actions together under Edit, and hid pending-only actions until changes are staged without changing any command keys.
- Removed Clutch's duplicate PostgreSQL transaction-state tracking and explicit-array-bound rejection now that pg-el exposes `ReadyForQuery` status and parses dimension-prefixed array values upstream.
- Allowed the native live-test runner to continue under Podman instead of exiting during the macOS-only OrbStack guard.
- Extended the active column-header background across the full cell width instead of highlighting only the label text.
- Suppressed automatic child-frame cell previews while refining a rectangular result selection.
- Prevented completion input from aborting native PostgreSQL responses and contaminating later queries or foreign-key metadata caches; malformed PostgreSQL foreign-key rows now fail at the adapter boundary.
- Made staged SQL mutations fail closed: hidden row-identity columns are verified at their injected trailing positions, computed or uncertain projections are read-only, writable identifiers are reconciled with canonical backend metadata, and multi-statement batches cannot partially commit.  SQLite batches use a real transaction; unsupported autocommit and already-dirty manual transactions fail before execution.
- Kept SQL highlighting enabled when query consoles are created, with dialect state local to each console, object definition, and preview buffer. Connection binding and rebinding select or reset the product deterministically, including Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, and Redshift mappings, without changing the user's global `sql-product` default.
- Updated the JDBC agent pin to 0.2.14. The agent now poisons connections whose timed-out driver work does not stop, serializes each metadata session, redacts embedded JDBC URL credentials, validates exact protocol integers, bounds large response cells, and avoids an unconditional liveness round trip before every query. It also recognizes Oracle `ORA-12592` as a fatal JDBC connection failure, replaces only an affected metadata session, limits recovery to one retry, and invalidates any replacement whose schema cannot be restored. Fatal primary-session responses explicitly invalidate only their local JDBC handle. After a configurable idle interval, the agent validates the primary session before statement creation; only a query-console, REPL, or batch statement proven not to have started may reconnect and run once in auto-commit or a clean manual transaction. Dirty manual transactions, partially completed batches, staged mutations, and failures after statement preparation or execution are never replayed. Manual-commit connection setup now fails rather than silently continuing in auto-commit when a driver lacks that capability. Metadata recovery treats an unsupported `Connection.isValid` probe as unavailable while still replacing sessions after concrete connection failures. Column metadata now includes optional default expressions from standard JDBC `COLUMN_DEF` and Oracle `DATA_DEFAULT`.
- Kept row-identity metadata failures in structured diagnostics instead of displaying raw backend errors as a primary-key warning. Read-only results retain a visible warning icon and color for `row editing unavailable E/D off`; edit and delete commands still surface the precise failure with debug-buffer guidance.
- Bounded native MongoDB find results and Redis key discovery/generated collection browsing.  Redis discovery now has both key-count and SCAN-batch limits, with exact key lookup beyond the initial object snapshot.  MongoDB endpoint labels use required public client metadata, and MongoDB/Redis object paths consistently translate protocol failures to `clutch-db-error`.
- Kept PostgreSQL dollar-quoted function bodies intact during statement selection, and stopped a permanently failing object-metadata category from retrying forever or starving later warmup categories.
- Made fragmented JDBC responses scan incrementally instead of repeatedly from the start of the process buffer, dropped late timeout responses and deferred callbacks for disconnected sessions, required an exact cancel acknowledgement before preserving a session, and bounded fetch batches to 1–10,000 rows.
- Reused warm SQL statement analysis without rescanning the whole query buffer, refreshed only the result footer after aggregation, and coalesced resize bursts through the existing column-width timer.
- Preserved the active `WHERE`-filtered result view after committing staged SQL mutations by refreshing through the result buffer's normal rerun contract.
- Kept connection chrome synchronized across transaction changes and connection loss: headers detect asynchronously closed backends, attached result footers update immediately without stale transaction state, failed query interruption invalidates derived buffers, and DML outcome banners remain intact.
- Isolated schema, table metadata, async refresh, and object warmup state by live connection identity, so simultaneous connections with the same display label no longer share caches or refresh each other's result buffers, and retired connections are not retained by warmup freshness bookkeeping.
- Rejected Oracle URLs configured through generic `:backend jdbc` before connection setup, with guidance to use the Oracle backend and its SQL dialect.
- Prevented point-local DWIM execution from sending detached `--` divider paragraphs before the semicolon-delimited SQL at point.
- Removed hidden connection-construction retries and broad capability fallbacks, so backend failures reach the normal command error boundary with their original cause.
- Stopped hiding native and JDBC disconnect failures or non-database errors during synchronous schema refresh; transport cleanup still runs at the owning connection boundary.
- Replaced PostgreSQL primary-key ordering through `array_position(int2vector, smallint)` with explicit array subscripts over `pg_index.indkey`, restoring row identity and result editing on GaussDB in PostgreSQL compatibility mode while preserving composite-key order.

## 0.2.4 - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Updated the bundled JDBC agent pin to 0.2.8. JDBC staged mutations now bind positional values through `PreparedStatement` instead of rendering literals into SQL.

### Fixed

- Recovered an idle-timed-out JDBC metadata session independently, restoring its schema and retrying the metadata request once without replacing the healthy primary session or its transaction state.
- Encoded JDBC boolean parameters as JSON booleans, including false autocommit, and made the agent reject non-boolean protocol values.
- Preserved catalog, schema, and table components from qualified JDBC source names when resolving row identity, including delimited SQL Server names.
- Surfaced native MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite metadata failures through the shared backend error boundary; synchronous Eldoc lookups remain quiet while recording recoverable warnings for diagnostics.

## 0.2.3 - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Added `:profile-entry` saved-connection profiles so encrypted pass or `.authinfo.gpg` entries can provide connection metadata while explicit `clutch-connection-alist` keys override profile defaults.

### Changed

- Updated the bundled JDBC agent pin to 0.2.7, adding generic JDBC table remarks while retaining checksum verification against the published jar.
- Unified header-line shortcut hints around status-first text followed by colored key/action pairs.
- Result headers now fall back to built-in text sort indicators (`↕`, `↑`, `↓`) when `nerd-icons` is unavailable, so sortable columns remain visible.

### Fixed

- Finished failed background schema refreshes when the connection closes, so query consoles no longer remain stuck at `[schema...]` after a MySQL metadata query hits a closed process.
- Prevented Query Console Eldoc from looping indefinitely when resolving table aliases in a non-final UNION branch.
- Allowed sorting UNION, grouped, derived, and other non-rewritable query results by falling back to a stable client-side sort of the current page.
- Reduced result-grid render work for wide pages by precomputing visible column metadata, avoiding repeated row-identity extraction while rendering staged state, and fast-pathing ordinary non-JSON/XML cell text.
- Extended graphical font-metric detection to Japanese and Korean fallback glyphs so mixed CJK result grids enable pixel alignment when those scripts do not match Emacs logical cell widths.
- Kept the current result cell selected when clicking the empty window area below the rendered table, while preserving normal cell clicks and mouse drag selection.
- Kept the result cursor on the last rendered row when mouse-wheel scrolling to the bottom of the table.
- Displayed database NULL as `<null>` in value viewers to match result and record cells.
- Opened REPL `SELECT` results in the standard result buffer instead of expanding wide tables inline in the REPL history, and styled REPL prompts, errors, and execution summaries for clearer command history.
- Recreated the REPL's dummy comint process before sending input or printing output so `RET` keeps working after the process disappears.
- Kept semicolons and parameter markers inside quoted SQL identifiers from being parsed as statement boundaries or placeholders, including doubled delimiter escapes in MySQL backticks and SQL Server brackets.
- Routed CTE-prefixed `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` statements through the DML path instead of treating every `WITH` statement as a pageable query.
- Reported delimiter-only query buffers as empty input instead of dispatching an invalid internal query.
- Avoided broad auth-source password lookups when connection params have no host/user/port target, and avoided resolving saved connection passwords twice during interactive connect.
- Let explicit saved-connection `:backend` values guide backend-specific parsing for `:profile-entry` fields, so profiles can omit `backend` while keeping typed values such as Redis database numbers.
- Kept query consoles with the same display name but different connection identities in separate buffers instead of overwriting the existing console.
- Kept malformed JSON-looking text values in the plain value viewer instead of routing them to the JSON viewer.
- Copied Org tables with display-width alignment and right-aligned numeric columns.
- Required JSON edit sub-editors to start from valid JSON text, keeping invalid insert/edit buffer contents in place with a field-specific error.
- Rendered PostgreSQL array mutation parameters as curly-brace array literals, so editing array cells no longer sends JSON-style `[ ... ]` text as a string.
- Rejected stale edit buffers when the target row or original cell value changes before the edit is finished, avoiding staged updates against replaced results.
- Kept record view, region TSV copy, aggregate, edit/re-edit, and clone-to-insert actions aligned with the currently visible filtered rows, including filters that match no rows.
- Centered the target column in the result window when jumping by column name.
- Preserved the result buffer viewport when returning from cell edit buffers and when query-result refreshes restore the current cell.
- Rendered SQL NULL values in record view with the same `<null>` placeholder used by result cells.
- Allowed `C-c '` to edit fields from record view and refreshed the record view after staging the field edit.
- Avoided staging unchanged cell edits whose editable text still matches the original value, including numeric cells.
- Allowed `C-c C-k` in record view to discard the staged change at the current field.
- Removed the redundant `Field : Value` heading from record view.
- Cleared SQL WHERE-filter state when a new query replaces the result, avoiding stale filters in rerun, sort, and footer state.
- Escaped CSV column names and carriage returns using the same rules as result values so exported records remain structurally valid.
- Required native MongoDB `deleteOne` and `deleteMany` helpers to receive an explicit filter document instead of treating missing filters as `{}`.
- Rejected native MongoDB `insertOne` and `insertMany` helper calls whose payloads are not document values.
- Reduced large-schema completion and object discovery spikes by scanning query buffers once for referenced table identifiers and grouping object-cache entries without repeated list appends.
- Reduced Query Console Eldoc table-comment latency by priming comments from table discovery for MySQL/PostgreSQL and accepting optional JDBC table-entry comments when the agent supplies them.
- Reduced wide result-grid TAB navigation latency by caching normalized header sort indicators and reusing computed column widths during horizontal visibility checks.
- Avoided synchronous foreign-key and insert-placeholder metadata loads while rendering result buffers, and used row-local redraws for staged insert rows when the rendered grid shape stays stable.
- Made insert buffers show all fields by default and advertise the `C-c .` current-time shortcut in the header line.
- Clarified result footer cursor text by labeling column position as `Col current/total [column-name]`.
- Opened valid JSON object and array text cells in the JSON cell editor so JSON-like text fields get formatting and highlighting while editing.
- Made `C-c C-c` and `C-c C-k` in automatically opened JSON cell editors stage or cancel the whole cell edit instead of falling back to the compact parent edit buffer first.
- Kept result header horizontal scrolling aligned with the body when graphical pixel padding and icon sort indicators are active.
- Kept result headers aligned with rows when fallback sort indicators and short NULL columns are displayed together.
- Classified Oracle sources before row-identity metadata lookup, so dictionary views such as `ALL_TABLES` and `USER_TABLES` skip JDBC primary-key, column, index, and `ROWID` probes.  This prevents ORA-01445 and ORA-12592 while keeping `ROWID` fallback for confirmed base tables.  Schema-qualified JDBC queries retain the same schema for metadata and staged mutation targets.

## 0.2.2 - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Reduced graphical result-grid redraw work by caching plain cell pixel widths per character, avoiding display-space properties for ordinary padding, reusing rendered cells across redraws and same-shape page refreshes, skipping body scans when sorting the same rows, rendering rows in a single pass, and measuring only changed columns after manual column-width adjustments. Result buffers now also skip pixel layout entirely when the frame's font metrics already match Emacs logical cell widths.
- Fixed result rendering on Emacs builds where `string-pixel-width` accepts only one argument.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- Aligned graphical result headers and body cells using measured pixel widths, including mixed ASCII/CJK font fallback configurations whose glyph widths do not follow a 1:2 ratio. Logical column sizing, terminal rendering, navigation, and existing column-width controls are unchanged. Result rendering now also uses the displayed result window's font metrics, keeps header-line horizontal scrolling aligned with pixel padding, and refreshes stale pixel layout after buffer-local face metric changes.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-01

This section summarizes the 0.2.0 release.

### Breaking Changes

- Native MySQL and PostgreSQL protocol packages are no longer installed through `clutch` package dependencies. Install `mysql.el` for `:backend mysql` and `pg.el` / `pg-el` for `:backend pg` in environments that do not already have those packages.
- Internal backend facade consumers must require `clutch-backend.el` instead of `clutch-db.el`. Custom backend adapters also need to follow the current backend contract, including `clutch-db-object-definition` rather than the old show-create-specific hooks.
- Generic JDBC URL configurations now require an explicit `:driver-class`. Built-in JDBC backend aliases such as Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, Snowflake, Redshift, and ClickHouse still provide their own driver classes.

### Added

- Added the native MongoDB backend as `:backend mongodb`. The default MongoDB surface uses the external `mongodb.el` package and a basic MongoDB Shell / MQL helper query buffer, not `mongosh`, JavaScript evaluation, or JDBC.
- Added MongoDB SQL Interface as a `:surface sql-interface` path on the same `mongodb` backend. This keeps MongoDB as one user-facing backend while still supporting Atlas / Enterprise Advanced SQL Interface endpoints through JDBC when that surface exists.
- Added `clutch-document.el` for document query-buffer behavior. It currently provides MongoDB helper syntax, highlighting, completion, statement boundaries, and document query-buffer dispatch.
- Added MongoDB object and metadata workflows: collection describe/profile output, object definition JSON, index insight, validation metadata, collection stats, sample explain, browse command generation, and database/collection schema refresh.
- Added MongoDB result-grid mapping for sampled document fields. Nested documents and arrays are treated as JSON-valued cells and native MongoDB result copy/export can generate helper snippets such as `insertOne`, `insertMany`, `replaceOne`, `updateOne`, and `deleteOne`.
- Added a basic Redis key/value backend as `:backend redis`, using the external `redis.el` RESP client. Redis supports command execution, key browsing, type-aware value display, TTL metadata, and result-grid mapping for common Redis data structures.
- Added backend support-level documentation that separates core SQL support, basic SQL/query-first support, basic document support, basic key/value support, and SQL Interface surfaces.
- Added architecture documentation with diagrams for module layering, backend surfaces, connection flow, query/result flow, object flow, and lazy optional dependency loading.

### Fixed

- Fixed copy transient loading with the Transient version bundled in Emacs 29. The copy refine toggle no longer depends on newer `:refresh-suffixes` support.

### Changed

- Renamed the generic database facade from `clutch-db.el` to `clutch-backend.el`. Workflow modules now route through the generic backend contract instead of depending on concrete protocol packages.
- Extended the backend registry with data-model, support-level, query-mode, surface, and normalization metadata. This keeps SQL, document, key/value, and JDBC surfaces explicit at the registry boundary.
- Moved backend-specific connection parameter normalization into backend registry entries instead of hard-coding concrete backend normalization inside the facade.
- Made optional protocol dependencies lazy and backend-specific. Native `mysql.el`, `pg.el`, `mongodb.el`, and `redis.el` are required only when the matching backend is used, and missing packages report connection-time errors.
- Refined result action ownership. `clutch-result.el` owns result state, paging/filter/sort/refine state, value/record workflows, and the result action registry; `clutch-ui.el` owns shared grid/header/footer rendering helpers; `clutch-edit.el` owns staged mutation state.
- Updated result-cell truncation so incomplete cell display uses a compact single-character ellipsis (`…`) instead of silently cutting text.
- Updated header-line shortcut hints so shortcut keys and their descriptions use distinct faces, matching the visual separation used by Transient.
- Made result column sorting a single three-state cycle. Pressing `s` on the current column or clicking a result column header now cycles unsorted, ascending, descending, then unsorted again; use `C` to jump to another visible column first. Headers show original-size neutral, ascending, and descending icons after column names.
- Made transient menus expose current operational state using highlighted choices. Auto-commit, copy refinement, filters, sorting, result layout, staged mutation counts, and Record field actions now update their labels from the active buffer context; unavailable stateful actions remain visible but inapt.
- Updated JSON result-cell display to match a DataGrip-like rule: short JSON is shown inline with lightweight token highlighting, while long JSON shows a compact prefix ending in `…` and remains unhighlighted.
- Kept binary BLOB cells compact with `<BLOB>` placeholders, while allowing small JDBC JSON/XML text BLOBs to use the normal compact text display path.
- Reworked live workflow test backend selection around a shared capability table so SQL-native and JDBC workflow coverage no longer depends on scattered hard-coded backend lists.
- Reworked MongoDB query-console completion around common helpers, collection names, sampled field names, aggregation stages/operators, and supported cursor helper chains.
- Clarified that DuckDB belongs to the SQL-first model and is currently reached through generic JDBC configuration.

### Fixed

- Fixed copy transient state labels so toggling `-r` follows the live switch value and immediately refreshes the highlighted `No|Yes` choice.
- Preserved manually adjusted result column widths when sort or paging reloads rows for the same column set.
- Fixed result header sort icons so their graphical width stays aligned with the monospace result grid.
- Refined result header sort indicators and column-name underlining so spacing after the name stays visually clean.
- Prevented result column navigation and stale header clicks from silently targeting hidden or different columns during sorting.
- Reduced SQL first-query latency by stopping row-identity metadata lookup after the first usable candidate across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and JDBC; MySQL unique-index fallback now uses scoped `SHOW KEYS` metadata.
- Delayed automatic schema cache refresh after connecting until Emacs has been idle for the configured delay, so native metadata refresh is less likely to occupy the foreground connection before the first query.
- Recover native MySQL connections after a client-side query read timeout by cancelling and draining the timed-out server query; when recovery fails, close the connection instead of letting later UI metadata requests reuse an unsynchronized protocol stream.
- Deferred automatic JDBC schema refresh until the configured idle window, so Oracle/JDBC metadata preheat does not start immediately after connecting.
- Updated the bundled JDBC agent pin to 0.2.6. JDBC metadata requests no longer block foreground execution, and small UTF-8/GB18030 JSON/XML BLOB values can render through the normal text/JSON/XML cell display path.
- Fixed result-grid rendering for JDBC JSON text stored in BLOB columns, so the cell shows a compact JSON prefix with `…` instead of falling back to `<BLOB>`.
- Throttled repeated result-grid column width changes, so holding `=` or `-` updates the width state continuously while limiting full table redraws and skipping cursor-only header/footer refresh work.  Reduced the default width step so manual column resizing feels smoother.
- Kept SQL expression completion scoped to columns, so `WHERE` and similar clauses no longer include statement table names as identifier candidates.
- Kept point on the edited result cell after staging or cancelling a cell edit, instead of returning to the start of the result table.
- Preserved clear boundary errors for unsupported MongoDB helper syntax instead of passing unsupported shell-only constructs to an external process.
- Improved MongoDB metadata buffers so JSON object definitions, collection profiles, stats, validation, and explain output are rendered as formatted JSON instead of table-style describe output.
- Fixed row-identity metadata error visibility so MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and JDBC adapter lookup failures are surfaced instead of being indistinguishable from absent metadata.
- Improved object action availability and presentation so MongoDB-only actions are enabled only for MongoDB collection entries and do not leak into SQL object buffers.
- Kept native document and key/value surfaces out of SQL-only staged mutation, manual transaction, row-identity edit, and SQL rewrite workflows.
- Made JDBC connections send an explicit driver class to the sidecar. This prevents unrelated registered JDBC drivers from claiming the same URL prefix; generic `:backend jdbc` connections now require `:driver-class`.

### Documentation

- Added `docs/mongodb-backend.org` with MongoDB native and SQL Interface requirements, configuration examples, query-buffer behavior, supported helper families, Clutch concept mapping, object actions, and live test notes.
- Added `docs/backend-support.org` to document support levels and boundaries for MongoDB, MongoDB SQL Interface, DuckDB, Redis, and future database categories.
- Added `docs/architecture.md` as the current module and backend architecture map.
- Updated README and existing backend docs for MongoDB, Redis, JDBC driver setup, optional protocol packages, and support-level terminology.
- Added postmortem records for MongoDB JDBC boundaries, query-mode facets, object actions, validation/stats actions, cursor-chain completion, document result capability gates, Redis basic support, metadata error visibility, and result action ownership.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with architecture, optional dependency, MongoDB, protocol-package, and refactoring guardrails for future work.

### Tests

- Split the large test suite into more focused files for connection, debug, live workflow, object workflow, backend behavior, and shared helpers.
- Added native MongoDB unit coverage for helper parsing, BSON constructor handling, query result mapping, schema sampling, object metadata, collection actions, SQL Interface routing, and error translation.
- Added Redis backend tests for key scanning, key metadata, type-aware browse queries, command result mapping, and live connection/query/schema behavior.
- Extended the live test runner to cover PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and Redis containers under the native live test workflow.
- Added result rendering tests for JSON inline display, JSON truncation, compact ellipsis behavior, custom column displayers, and BLOB compact width.

### Compatibility Notes

- MongoDB user configuration should use `:backend mongodb`. `:backend mongodb :surface sql-interface` is the only MongoDB SQL Interface configuration path.
- Native MongoDB requires the external `mongodb.el` package. MongoDB SQL Interface requires the JDBC sidecar and MongoDB JDBC driver jar.
- Redis requires the external `redis.el` package.
- Native MongoDB and Redis support are intentionally basic and do not expose SQL row editing, joins, SQL transaction UI, SQL row identity editing, or SQL-only rewrite workflows.
